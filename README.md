This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Python: failing to close a file handle after use.  The `bug.py` file shows the function with the error.  `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version using the `with` statement for automatic resource management.  Unclosed files can lead to resource exhaustion, especially in long-running programs or when dealing with many files.
